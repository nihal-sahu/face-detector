# opencv-face-detector
Takes video input from connected webcam and highlights all faces identified.

Using Python 3.9 and OpenCV Library. 
Uses prebuilt frontal face detection xml file (not made by me).
Currently walking on a user-friendly interface to incorporate games.
Wanted to add the working version of the face identification beforehand.
